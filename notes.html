<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>Intro</h1>
<p>In this talk I'm going to be speaking about front end security to protect against malicious content on the web.</p>
<p>The main focus of this talk is to help us stitch better security into the web.</p>
<p>The notes, slides and demos are available online and will share the link at the end of the talk.</p>
<h1>Attacks</h1>
<p>The attacks available online range from displaying adverts maliciously to stealing of financial data.</p>
<p>Security was traditionally considered just a back end job to protect. that is still the case;
however SPA, offline web and the internet of things really make FE security an requirement.</p>
<p>OWASP and WhiteHat sec either vote XSS the highest vulnerability or close to that. With stats ranging from 49% of sites being impacted.</p>
<p>CSP is the concept I will be using to prevent these attacks.</p>
<h1>What CSP does</h1>
<p>Content security policies are a defined set of restrictions which get transmitted when you load a web page.</p>
<p>I see CSP as a very similar principle to accepting app permissions on phones.</p>
<p>This allows website owners to define a set of capabilities their site uses and the browser will enforce those as restrictions on the code that runs.</p>
<p>These restrictions then prevent an attacker from executing code that really wasn't designed to run.</p>
<h1>CSP looks like</h1>

<h1>Why does CSP matter?</h1>
<p>&quot;I discount the probability of perfection&quot; - Alex Russell</p>
<p>&quot;We are all idiots with deadlines.&quot; - Mike West</p>
<p>Basically, people make mistakes and CSP is a great protection in all good browsers that support it. The more layers of security we can add the smaller the dependency there is on perfect setup.</p>

<h1>Who is finding it tough</h1>
<ul>
<li>everyone?</li>
<li>https://scotthelme.co.uk/
<ul>
<li>modpagespeed is adding data: and 'unsafe-eval' script usage</li>
<li>Disqus requires 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline' CSS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>https://certsimple.com
<ul>
<li>Ractive is using 'unsafe-eval' scripts</li>
<li>Selectize using 'unsafe-inline' CSS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Top million sites</h1>
<p><img src="images/csp-usage.png" alt="Graph showing low 1-2% usage of CSP in the top million sites"></p>
<h1>Why is it hard</h1>
<p>Locking down capabilities of a big site is actually difficult. In a larger organisation where many developers are involved in each page it becomes difficult to work out what the site is doing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of role in a company to do that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>visibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Common issues</p>

<h1>Libraries</h1>
<p>One of the main problems of an application developer is using third party code and libraries.</p>
<p>I think libraries are most used to testing their code in isolation for security flaws.
However what I think needs to be said, is that libraries are responsible for the security of the apps that use them.</p>
<h2>Libraries have a far reaching impact to the web.</h2>
<h3>Demonstrate to their users</h3>
<h3>Despite testing open up other applications</h3>
<h3>A library is responsible to it's users</h3>
<h1>Libs: start with the most restrictive policy first</h1>
<p>Start with the most restrictive policy first:</p>
<pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none' ; frame-ancestors 'none' ; form-action 'none' ; block-all-mixed-content; sandbox; reflected-xss block; referrer no-referrer;
</code></pre>
<p>Soon you will need to add in other policies like allowing scripts and your addon URLs.</p>
<h1>Libs: make it static</h1>
<ul>
<li>Turn it all off first then turn directives back on when you 100% need them</li>
</ul>
<p>For example <code>style=&quot;color:red;&quot;</code> can be replaced with <code>dom.style.color = 'red';</code></p>
<h1>Libs: Provide an example report</h1>
<p>Showing users how to integrate
Users will find it hard to find out themselves; in some cases as hard as 'the halting problem'.
If you can make parts of you app optional that is cool too.</p>
<h1>JSON CSP</h1>
<p>So I have started to make a new standard because; you know it's not like FE doesn't have enough to learn.</p>
<p>Actually all JSON CSP is for is just specifying a more universal format that can be used across the web.</p>
<p>JSON CSP is there for application authors to consume the policies of the libraries they use to make a composite policy that is easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Relationship between both application universe and library sphere.</p>
<p>Obviously this is at the moment mostly a goal to secure the net, however there appears to be great traction to using this through frameworks in only several weeks.</p>
<h1>Reporting &amp; testing</h1>
<p>Reporting and testing go hand in hand, testing helps stomp out most of the issues before it goes live.</p>
<p>Before getting to the site your code where possible should be tested.</p>
<p>Reporting is actually really important to review how your application is performing.
You can actually use both a policy and a report only policy.</p>
<h1>secure.fail</h1>
<p>So that is the carrots over with, Secure.fail is a site that I am working on to be the stick of FE security.</p>
<p>Giving libraries new resources to implement security is great, however we need to back that up with something that also tells websites and libraries that they are doing badly.</p>
<p>So this will only be for FE for now as the disclosure battle isn't something I want to get into.</p>
